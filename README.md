# Mohit Kumawat - Personal Portfolio

Welcome to my personal portfolio website! This project showcases my skills, education, projects, achievements, and contact information as an aspiring Software Developer currently pursuing a B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering at IIIT Guwahati.

## Overview

This is a simple, responsive portfolio website built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It features smooth scrolling navigation, a clean design, and an interactive contact section. The purpose of this project is to present my background and technical abilities to potential employers, collaborators, or anyone interested in my work.

## Features

- **Smooth Scrolling Navigation**: Clicking on navigation links smoothly scrolls to the respective section.
- **Interactive Contact Section**: Clicking the contact section triggers an alert with a message.
- **Responsive Design**: The layout adapts to different screen sizes using basic CSS styling.
- **Sections**:
  - **About Me**: Details about my education and skills.
  - **Projects**: Placeholder for showcasing my projects (to be expanded).
  - **Achievements**: Highlights of my certifications and competitive exam ranks.
  - **Contact**: My email and phone number for reaching out.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Structure of the webpage.
- **CSS3**: Styling and layout (custom styles in `styles.css`).
- **JavaScript**: Smooth scrolling and interactive alert functionality (in `script.js`).
